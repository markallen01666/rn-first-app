# rn-first-app

This is a simple React Native App built using Expo. It's my first React Native app and I put it together following Max Swarzmuller's course "React Native - The Practical Guide" on Udemy.

The app build on the first module lessons adding in some extra functionality including a button that toggles the message and a reset button.
